# Building-a-Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-System-A-Step-by-Step-Guide
Introduction:
Welcome to our collaborative filtering recommender systems lab! In this hands-on exercise, we'll dive into the world of recommendation engines and explore how collaborative filtering can be leveraged to build a movie recommender system. By the end of this lab, you'll have implemented key algorithms and gained insights into how to create personalized recommendations for users.


Understanding Recommender Systems:
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to predict user preferences or provide personalized recommendations based on historical data. Collaborative filtering is one of the most popular techniques used in building recommender systems.

Exploring the Movie Ratings Dataset:
For this exercise, we'll utilize a movie ratings dataset containing ratings given by users to various movies. Each row of the dataset represents a user's rating for a specific movie.

Navigating the Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm:
Let's delve into the collaborative filtering learning algorithm:

4.1 Collaborative Filtering Cost Function:
The cost function for collaborative filtering aims to minimize the squared error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings given by users. Here's the implementation of the cost function:

# GRADED FUNCTION: cofi_cost_func
# UNQ_C1

def cofi_cost_func(X, W, b, Y, R, lambda_):
    """
    Returns the cost for the content-based filtering
    Args:
      X (ndarray (num_movies,num_features)): matrix of item features
      W (ndarray (num_users,num_features)) : matrix of user parameters
      b (ndarray (1, num_users)            : vector of user parameters
      Y (ndarray (num_movies,num_users)    : matrix of user ratings of movies
      R (ndarray (num_movies,num_users)    : matrix, where R(i, j) = 1 if the i-th movies was rated by the j-th user
      lambda_ (float): regularization parameter
    Returns:
      J (float) : Cost
    """
    nm, nu = Y.shape
    J = 0
    
    # Compute predictions
    predictions = np.dot(X, W.T) + b
    
    # Compute squared error
    error = (predictions - Y) * R
    squared_error = np.sum(error ** 2) / 2
    
    # Regularization term
    reg_term = (lambda_ / 2) * (np.sum(W ** 2) + np.sum(X ** 2) + np.sum(b ** 2))
    
    # Total cost
    J = squared_error + reg_term   
    
    return J
Exercise 1: Implementing the Collaborative Filtering Cost Function

Learning Movie Recommendations:
Once we've implemented the cost function, we can use optimization algorithms like gradient descent to learn the parameters that minimize the cost function.

Making Recommendations:
After learning the parameters, we can predict ratings for movies that a user has not yet rated. These predictions enable us to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
